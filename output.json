        "to look at it even in the middle of the night. You have the privilege",
        "of sending something extra such as a file, graphics, images",
        "etc. along with your e-mail. The biggest advantage of using e-",
        "mail is that it is cheap, especially when sending messages to",
        "other states or countries and at the same time it can be delivered",
        "to a number of people around the world.",
        "It allows you to compose note, get the address of the recipient",
        "and send it. Once the mail is received and read, it can be",

        "(ii) Components of an E-mail Address",
        "As in the case of normal mail system, e-mail is also based",
        "upon the concept of a recipient address. The email address",
        "Introduction to Internet  :: 57",
        "provides all of the information required to get a message to the",
        "recipient from any where in the world. Consider the e-mail ID.",
        "john@hotmail.com",
        "In the above example john is the username of the person who",
        "will be sending/receiving the email. Hotmail is the mail server",
        "where the username john has been registered and com is the",
        "type of organization on the internet which is hosting the mail",
        "server.",
        "(b) FTP (File Transfer Protocol)",
        "File Transfer Protocol, is an Internet utility software used to",
        "uploaded and download files. It gives access to directories or",
        "folders on remote computers and allows software, data and",
        "text files to be transferred between different kinds of computers.",
        "FTP works on the basis of same principle as that of Client/",
        "Server. FTP “Client” is a program running on your computer",
        "that enables you to communicate with remote computers. The",
        "FTP client takes FTP command and sends these as requests",
        "for information from the remote computer known as FTP",
        "servers. To access remote FTP server it is required, but not",
        "necessary to have an account in the FTP server. When the FTP",
        "client gets connected, FTP server asks for the identification",
        "in terms of User Login name and password of the FTP client",
        "(Fig. 3.1). If one does not have an account in the remote FTP",
        "server, still he can connect to the server using anonymous",
        "login.",
        "Using anonymous login anyone can login in to a FTP server",
        "and can access public archives; anywhere in the world, without",

        "3.5.1 Dial up connection",
        "Dial-up refers to an Internet connection that is established",
        "using a modem. The modem connects the computer to standard",
        "phone lines, which serve as the data transfer medium. When a",
        "user initiates a dial-up connection, the modem dials a phone",
        "number of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that is designated",
        "to receive dial-up calls. The ISP then establishes the connection,",
        "which usually takes about ten seconds and is accompanied by",
        "several beepings and a buzzing sound.",
        "60 :: Computer and Office Applications",
        "After the dial-up connection has been established, it is active",
        "until the user disconnects from the ISP. Typically, this is done",
        "by selecting the “Disconnect” option using the ISP’s software",
        "or a modem utility program. However, if a dial-up connection",
        "is interrupted by an incoming phone call or someone picking",
        "up a phone in the house, the service may also be disconnected.",
        "Advantages",
        "Low Price",
        "Secure connection – your IP address continually changes",

        "Leased connection is a permanent telephone connection",
        "between two points set up by a telecommunications common",
        "carrier. Typically, leased lines are used by businesses to connect",
        "geographically distant offices. Unlike normal dial-up",
        "connections, a leased line is always active. The fee for the",
        "connection is a fixed monthly rate. The primary factors affecting",
        "the monthly fee are distance between end points and the speed",

        "service. Although fed from the same coax that provides cable",
        "TV service, most companies place a splitter outside of the",
        "building and runs two cables in, rather than using a splitter at",
        "the set-top box. The coax terminates at the cable modem.",
        "The cable modem itself attaches to the SOHO computing",
        "equipment via its 10BASE-T port. In most circumstances, the",
        "cable modem attaches directly to a user’s computer. If a LAN",
        "is present on the premises (something many cable companies",
        "frown upon), some sort of router can be connected to the cable",
        "modem.",
        "Advantages",
        "Always Connected: A cable modem connection is always",
        "connected to the Internet. This is advantageous because",
        "you do not have to wait for your computer to “log on” to",
        "the Internet; however, this also has the disadvantage of",
        "making your computer more vulnerable to hackers.",
        "Broadband: Cable modems transmit and receive data as",
        "64 :: Computer and Office Applications",
        "digital packets, meaning they provide high-speed Internet",
        "access. This makes cable modem connections much faster",
        "than traditional dial-up connections.",
        "Bandwidth:  Cable modems have the potential to receive",
        "data from their cable provider at speeds greater than 30",
        "megabits per second; unfortunately, this speed is rarely",
        "ever realized. Cable lines are shared by all of the cable",
        "modem users in a given area; thus, the connection speed",
        "varies depending upon the number of other people using",
        "the Internet and the amount of data they are receiving or",
        "transmitting.",
        "File Transfer Capabilities:  Downloads may be faster, but",
        "uploads are typically slower. Since the same lines are used",
        "to transmit data to and from the modem, priority is often",
        "given to data traveling in one direction.",
        "Signal Integrity:  Cable Internet can be transmitted long",
        "distances with little signal degradation. This means the",
        "quality of the Internet signal is not significantly decreased",
        "by the distance of the modem from the cable provider.",
        "Routing:  Cable routers allow multiple computers to be",
        "hooked up to one cable modem, allowing several devices",
        "to be directly connected through a single modem. Wireless",
        "routers can also be attached to your cable modem.",
        "Rely on Existing Connections:  Cable modems connect",
        "directly to preinstalled cable lines. This is advantageous",
        "because you do not need to have other services, such as",
        "telephone or Internet, in order to receive Internet through",
        "your cable modem. The disadvantage is that you cannot",
        "have cable internet in areas where there are no cable lines.",
        "Disadvantages",
        "Cable internet technology excels at maintaining signal",
        "strength over distance. Once it is delivered to a region,",
        "however, such as a neighborhood, it is split among that",
        "regions subscribers. While increased capacity has",
        "diminished the effect somewhat, it is still possible that",
        "users will see significantly lower speeds at peak times when",
        "more people are using the shared connection.",
        "Introduction to Internet  :: 65",
        "Bandwidth equals money, so cable’s advantage in",
        "throughput comes with a price. Even in plans of similar",
        "speeds compared with DSL, customers spend more per",
        "Mb with cable than they do with DSL.",
        "It’s hard to imagine, but there are still pockets of the United",
        "States without adequate cable television service. There are",
        "far fewer such pockets without residential land-line service",
        "meaning cable internet is on balance less accessible in",

        "Short for very small aperture terminal, an earthbound station",
        "used in satellite communications of data, voice and video",
        "signals, excluding broadcast television. A VSAT consists of two",
        "parts, a transceiver that is placed outdoors in direct line of",
        "sight to the satellite and a device that is placed indoors to",
        "interface the transceiver with the end user’s communications",
        "device, such as a PC. The transceiver receives or sends a signal",
        "to a satellite transponder in the sky. The satellite sends and",
        "receives signals from a ground station computer that acts as a",
        "hub for the system. Each end user is interconnected with the",
        "hub station via the satellite, forming a star topology. The hub",
        "controls the entire operation of the network. For one end user",
        "to communicate with another, each transmission has to first",
        "go to the hub station that then retransmits it via the satellite",

        "Upgradeable",
        "Low incremental costs per unit",
        "Disadvantages",
        "However like all systems there are disadvantages also. Some of",
        "these are",
        "66 :: Computer and Office Applications",
        "High start-up costs (hubs and basic elements must be in",
